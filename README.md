# Powershell-Get-FileDetails
 
This script is for getting the last date modification date from a file.
To make it work you need to create "in.txt" file under "C:/temp" folder.
Contents of the file should look somewhat like the below:

C:\Temp\a.txt

this specifies the file that needs to be checked.
When script runs you will get an output file under "C:/temp", named "out.txt" with the short date inside (29/04/2023).

This can be a good implementation for BluePrism automation as per below example
